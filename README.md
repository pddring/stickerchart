# StickerChart
This is the source code for [tools.withcode.uk/sticker](tools.withcode.uk/sticker) which I cobbled together as a digital sticker chart for potty training. I've shared it here in the hope that it may be useful for someone else to use or adapt.

The idea is to display it somewhere highly visible (e.g smart TV) whilst potty training to help motivate and reward (bribe) a toddler and avoid accidents.
