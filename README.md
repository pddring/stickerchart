Potty training sticker chart

This is the source code for tools.withcode.uk/sticker which I cobbled together as a digital sticker chart for potty training. 

The idea is to display it somewhere highly visible (e.g smart TV) whilst potty training to help motivate and reward (bribe) a toddler and avoid accidents.
